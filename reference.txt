***list operation
    (0, 0,  { values })    link to a new record that needs to be created with the given values dictionary
    (1, ID, { values })    update the linked record with id = ID (write values on it)
    (2, ID)                remove and delete the linked record with id = ID (calls unlink on ID, that will delete the object completely, and the link to it as well)
    (3, ID)                cut the link to the linked record with id = ID (delete the relationship between the two objects but does not delete the target object itself)
    (4, ID)                link to existing record with id = ID (adds a relationship)
    (5)                    unlink all (like using (3,ID) for all linked records)
    (6, 0, [IDs])          replace the list of linked IDs (like using (5) then (4,ID) for each ID in the list of IDs)
